    "\n",
    "Take a look at the way the classes were created and the corresponding outputs in the cells above.  A couple of things stand out:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  The `.tune_instrument()` method was never declared for class `Bass_Guitarist()`, but the `paul` instance still has access to this method.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. The `.instrument_type` attribute was never set for the `Bass_Guitarist()` class, but the `paul` instance nonetheless has that attribute, and the attribute has the same value as it had in the `Guitarist` class. This is because it inherited it from the `Guitarist()` calls through the `super().__init__()` method first.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. With inheritance, you can still change or overwrite specific attributes or methods. For example, in the `Bass_Guitarist()` class, the `.practice()` and `.perform()` methods, as well as the values for the `.name` and `.role` attributes all differ from the inherited `Guitarist()` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using `.super()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `super()` method gives you access to the superclass of the object that calls `super()`.  In this case, you saw how `super()` was used in the  `__init__()` method to initialize the object just as if we were creating a new `guitar` object. Afterward, you can modify attributes as needed.  Although not shown in this example, it is worth noting that you can also add attributes and methods to a subclass that a superclass does not have. For instance, if you added the attribute `self.string_type = 'bass'` inside the `Bass_Guitarist.__init__()` method, all bass guitarist objects would have that attribute, but guitarist objects would not.  Conversely, any changes that you make to the superclass `Guitarist()` will always be reflected in the subclass `Bass_Guitarist()`. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Changing Values and Methods \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in both of these classes, you have methods named `.practice()` that have the same name, but different behaviors. This is an example of **_Polymorphism_**, meaning that you can have methods that have the same name, but contain different code inside their bodies.  This is not a naming collision because these methods exist attached to different classes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, take note of the way the `.perform()` method is written inside of `Bass_Guitarist()`. If you want a method in a subclass to do everything that method does in a superclass and *then* do something else, you can accomplish this by simply calling the superclass's version of the method by accessing it with `super()` and then adding any remaining behavior afterward in the body of the function. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Accessing Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, subclasses have access to all methods contained in a superclass. Because they are a subclass, they can automatically do the same things as the corresponding superclass. You do not need to declare the functions in the body of the subclass to have access to them. For example, while there was no mention of the method `.tune_instrument()`, `paul` still has access to the exact same `.tune_instrument()` method as `george`.  You only declare methods that are mentioned in the superclass if you want to override their behavior in the subclass.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract Superclasses\n",
    "\n",
    "When you make use of a subclass and a superclass, you are defining levels of **_Abstraction_**. In this case, the superclass `Guitarist()` is one level of abstraction higher than the subclass `Bass_Guitarist()`. Intuitively, this makes sense -- bass guitarists are a kind of guitarist, but not all guitarists are bass guitarists.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also worth noting that you can always go a level of abstraction higher by defining a class that is more vague but still captures the common thread amongst the subclasses. Here's an example to demonstrate.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance, it may seem that guitarists, singers, and drummers don't have enough in common with each other to make use of inheritance -- a drummer is not a type of singer, etc. However, one thing they all have in common is they are all a type of `Musician()`. No matter what sort of musician you are, you:\n",
    "\n",
    "* have a `name`  \n",
    "* have an `instrument`  \n",
    "* know how to `tune_instrument`  \n",
    "* can `practice` and `perform`\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, you can write a single superclass that will be useful for all of the subclasses in our band: `Drummer()`, `Guitarist()`, `Bass_Guitarist()`, and `Singer()` are all types of musicians!\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called an **_Abstract Superclass_**. The superclass being used is at a level of abstraction where it does not make sense for it to exist on its own.  For example, it makes sense to instantiate drummers, singers, and guitarists -- they are members of a band, and by playing these instruments, they are musicians.  However, you cannot be a `musician` without belonging to one of these subclasses -- there is no such thing as a musician that doesn’t play any instruments or sing! It makes no sense to instantiate a `Musician()`, because they don't really exist in the real world -- you only create this **_Abstract Superclass_** to define the commonalities between our subclasses and save ourselves some redundant code!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating The Beatles Using an Abstract Superclass\n",
    "\n",
    "The cell below models the Beatles by making use of the abstract superclass `Musician()`, and then subclassing it when creating `Drummer()`, `Singer()`, and `Guitarist()`.  Note that since you can have multiple layers of abstraction, it makes sense to keep `Bass_Guitarist()` as a subclass of `Guitarist()`."
