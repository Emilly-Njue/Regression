ACTIVITIES

Follow the process below to develop a model that can be used by real estate companies and real estate agents to predict the price of a house.

Business Understanding -Conduct a literature review to understand the factors that determine the price of houses globally and locally. -Based on the dataset provided, formulate a business question to be answered through the analysis.

Data Understanding -The data in the dataset provided was collected through webs scrapping. Conduct further reading to understand the process of web scrapping, how it is conducted (methods and tools) and any ethical challenges related to it.

Data Preparation -Conduct a detailed exploratory analysis on the dataset. -Prepare the dataset for modeling -Identify the technique relevant for answering the business question stated above. -Ensure that the dataset meets all the assumptions of the technique identified. -Conduct preliminary feature selection by identifying the set of features that are likely to provide a model with good performance.

Modeling -Split the dataset into two; training set and validation set. With justifications, decide on the ratio of the training set to the validation set. -Generate the required model

Evaluation -Interpret the model in terms of its goodness of fit in predicting the price of houses. -Assume that the model is not good enough and then conduct further feature engineering or use any other model tuning strategies at your disposal to generate additional two instances of the model. -Settle on the best model instance and then re-interpret.

Implementation -Think of how the model can be implemented and used by real estate firms and agents. -Identify possible challenges of applying the model. -Recommendations on how the model can be improved in future
